## Description
The below shows an updated pipeline and example of the app (streamlit_app.py) for one major US city, Cleveland. The app will include the option to select a city which updates the visualization and charts. The user will also have the option to udpate the data with a butoon in addition to the weekly update via Airflow. 

## Next Steps
- Set up API calls to send date to MongoDB Atlas in Google Cloud
- Process and write data from the Cloud to a flat file to be read by the Streamlit app
- Set up scheduling with Airflow
- Host app with Heroku
